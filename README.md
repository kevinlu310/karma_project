# The Karma Project

This project was created for the international hackathon in Abu Dhabi in 2013 sponsored by New York
University. There was around 100 students participating. The mentors were not allowed to code, they
were only allowed to mentor the project, help with architecture, technologies, algorithms,
deployment, and anything that would help the students learn.

The beauty of this project is that the students were the only developers. They had different skill
set, some knew php, some knew very little JavaScript, some new python, and Java. So the mentors
challenge was to pick couple of technologies that would make this work. None of the members knew
NodeJS/BackboneJS/TwitterBootstrap but they were passionate to learn.
